### git-prompt.sh configuration file

This is the configuration file git bash. This is the way I like git bash terminal to look like. Feel free to use this configuration if you like.
I like it when it look more like ubuntu terminal. So change the background color to `48 10 38` and text color to `238 238 238` to get a feel of ubuntu like terminal.

HAPPY CODING
